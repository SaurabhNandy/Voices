            Was it Alexander the great? Genghis Khan? Julius Caesar? Hari Singh Nalwa? Or was it Napoleon Bonaparte? Not only is it none of the above, but it isn’t any other figure in history. Infact, we’re not talking humans here. One of the few things that humans depend on, on a daily basis is none other than the most densely grown crop - Wheat! Wheat was one of the first domesticated food crops which turned out to be the staple food of many civilizations of the world. Even today, it continues to be the most important food grain source for humans. It is grown on more land area than any commercial crops and its production leads all crops including rice, maize, corn and potatoes. Humans lived for almost 2.5 million years fed themselves by gathering plants and hunting. But about 10,000 years ago, one important landmark changed the course of history of humans – The Agricultural Revolution. It is often said that the Agricultural Revolution was a great leap forward for humanity. It is widely believed that evolution gradually produced more intelligent people and the progress was fuelled by human brain power. However, Yuval Noah Harari in his one of the most popular books, ‘Sapiens – A Brief History of Humankind’ presents some interesting arguments contradicting the above claims and popular beliefs. Ten thousand years ago, wheat was just a wild grass confined to areas of Middle East. Today, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of the globe’s surface (which is around 10 times the size of Britain!) Humans were living a comfortable life hunting and gathering. Humans had developed the better survival instincts and an intimate knowledge of animals they hunted, and plants they gathered. It even offered more leisure time and a better diet for us omnivorous humans. We require a wide variety of food, and grains make up only a small fraction of the same. It is poor in vitamins and minerals. It wasn’t easy to cultivate wheat. Wheat didn’t like rocks and pebbles, so we broke our backs clearing the field. It didn’t like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so we laboured long days under the scorching sun. In order to protect it from being attacked by rabbits and locust worms, we build fences and stand guard over the fields. Wheat was thirsty, so we dug irrigation canals or carried heavy buckets from wells to water it. Our body was not evolved for such tasks. Studies have shown that transition to agriculture brought a plethora of disorders such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernia. Agriculture demanded a lot of time and we were forced to settle next to the fields. We did not domesticate wheat, wheat domesticated us . We were the ones living in a house. Village life brought better protection against wild animals, rain and cold. It provided much more food per unit territory and enables humans to multiply exponentially. As time passed, there was a development of larger social frameworks such as cities, kingdoms, states and civilizations. Today, wheat is one of the most political commodities. We are heavily relied on it. It is the basic ingredient in bread. It’s production is highly sensitive to weather conditions around the world. Climatic conditions can decrease the production of wheat which leads to increased price of a wide range of commodities that further causes huge political pressure on governments. Moreover, agricultural commodities like wheat do not have a long shelf life. They deteriorate, lose protein content and rot over time. People around the world do not think about their daily bread when it is available but when the supply cannot meet the demand, watch out. It has been a cause of revolution and even civil problems for years and it is not likely to change anytime soon. It is losing its nutritional value which has led to scientific research at a global scale. We need to find ways to increase its production or find a replacement or get our spears and arrows ready to hunt?
